Identity Access Management is used to define user access permission within AWS 

There are 3 different Types of iam policies avaiable:

* Managed Policies
* Customer Managed Polocies
* Inline Policies

-> Managed Policy:

A managed policy is an policy which is created and administrated by AWS

AWS provide managed policies for common use cases based on job function e.g. AmazonDynamoDBFUllAccess,AWSCodeCommitPowerUser,AmzonEC2ReadOnlyAccess etc

These Aws provided policies allow you to assign appropriate permissions to your users,groups and roles without having to write the policy yourself

A single Managed Policy can be attached to multiple users,groups,or roles within the same AWS account and accross different accounts

You cannot change the permission defined in an AWS managed policy.

-> Customer Managed Policy:

A CMP is a standalone policy that you create and administer inside your own AWS account.You can attach this policy to multiple user ,group and roles-but only with in your own AWS account

In order to create a customer managed policy ,you can copy existing managed policy and customize it to fit the requirment of your organisation

Recommended for use cases where the existing AWS Managed Policies dont meet the need of your enviroment

-> Inline Policies:

An Inline Poliy is an IAM which actually embedded within the user group or role to which it applies. There is a strict 1:1 relationship between the entity and the policy.

When you delet th user,group,or role in which the inline policy is emebedde the policy will also be deleted 

In most cases,AWS recommended using managed policies over iniline policies 

Inline Policies are useful when you want to be sure that the permission in a policy are not inadvertenly assigned to any other user,group,or role than the one for which they're intended( i.e you are creating policy that must only ever be attached to a single user,group or role.)
