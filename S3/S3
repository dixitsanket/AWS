S3 provides developer and it team with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage. Amazon s3  is easy to use , with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

S3 is safe place to store file.
it is object based storage.
the data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

-> S3 Basics

s3 is object based - i.e. allows you to upload files
file can be from 0bytes to 5tb
there is unlimited storage
file are stored in buckets (similar to a folder)
S3 is a universal namespace. That is name must be unique globally
when you upload a file to s3 to recieve code 200 if upload was succesful

-> Data Consistency model for s3 

Read After write consistency for PUTS of new object
Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETS (can take some time to propogate)

-> S3 is a simple key-value store

S3 is object based.Object consist of the following:
-Key (this is simply the name of the object)
-Value (this is simply the data, which is made up of sequence of bytes)
-Version ID (important for versioning)
-Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
-Subresources - Bucket specific configuration:
	- Bucket Policies, Access control lists,
	- Cross Origin Resource Shareing (CORS)
	- Transfer Acceleration
-Built for 99.99% avalibility for the s3 platform
-Amazon gurantee 99.9 % availabilty
-Amazon gurantees 99.99999999999% durability for s3 information.
-Tiered Storage Available.
-Lifecycle Managment
-Versioning
-Encryption
-Secure you data - ACCESS

-> S3 - Storage Tiers/Classes

* S3: 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability ,store redundant across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is deisgned to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

* S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequent, but requires rapid access when needed.Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrival fee

* S3 one Zone IA : Same as IA howerver data is stored in a single avalibility zone only,still 99.99999999999% durability, but only 99.5% avalability .Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA.

* Reduce Redundancy Storage: Design to provide 99.99% avalibilty of object over given year. Used for data that can be recreated if lost eg thumnails 

* Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archive only.optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and it takes  3-5 hours to restore glacier.

* S3 Intelligent Tiering :
	-Unknow or unpredictable access patterns
	-2 tiers - frequent and infrequent access
	-Automatically moves your data to most cost-effective tier based on how frequent yor object is accessed
	-99.99999999999% durability
	-99.9 availiblity over a given year
	-optimizes cost
	-No fees for accessing your data but a small monthly fee for monitoring/automation $0.0025 per 1,000 objects
