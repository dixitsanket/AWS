SNS notification can also trigger lambda function:

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics.A topic is an "access point" for allowing recipients to dynamically  subscribe for identical copies of the same notification.

One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types-for example,you can group togather ios,Android and SMS recipients.When you publish once to a topic,SNS delivers appropriatly formatted copies of your message to each subscriber.
