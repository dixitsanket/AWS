Relational databases are what most of us are all used to. They have been around since the 70s. Think relational spreadsheet

* Database
* Tables
* Row
* Fields(Columns)

-> Types of Relational Databses in AWS

* SQL Server
* Oracle
* MySQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* Amazon Aurora
* MariaDB

-> Non Relational Databases:

* Database
* Collection         = Table
* Documents          = Row
* Key value pair     = Fields

-> Data Warehousing:

Used for buisness intelligence. Tools like Cognos,Jaspersoft,SQL Server, Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion,and SAP NetWeaver.

Used to pull in very large and complex dataset . Usually used by managment to do queries on data (such as current performance vs targets, etc.)

-> OLTP vs OLAP

Online transaction processing differs from OLAP in terms of the type of queries you will run.

* OLTP Example - 

Order number 2120121
Pull up a row of data such as name ,date ,address to deliver to, delivery status etc.

* OLAP Example - 
 
Net profit for EMEA and pacific for the digital radio product. Pulls in large number of records.

Sum of radio soldin EMEA
Sum of radios sold in Pacific
Unit cost of radio in each region
sales price of each radio 
sales price unit cost.

Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database prespective and infrastructure layer. 

-> ElastiCache:

ElastiCache is a web server that makes it easy to deploy,operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrive information from fast, managed, in memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk based databases.

* ElastiCache supports two open source in memory caching engines:

Memcached
Redis
