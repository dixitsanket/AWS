-> Backups:

There are two different types of Backups: Automated Backups and Database Snapshots

* Automated Backups:

Automated backups allow you to recover your databases to any point in time within a retention period. The retention period can be between one and 35 days. Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction log throughout the day. When you do a recovery AWS will first choose the most recent daily backup ,and then apply transaction log relevant to that day. This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to second, with retention period

Automated Backups are enable by default. The Backup data is stored in S3 and you get free storage space equal to the size of your database. So if youh have RDS instance of 10gb, you will get 10gb worth of storage.

Backup are taken within defined window.

During the backup window,storage I/O may be suspended while your data is being backed up and you may experience elevated latency

* SnapShots

DB Snapshots are done manually (ie they are user initiated). They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backup

-> Restoring Backup:

Whenever you restore either an automatic backup or manual snapshot,the restored version of the database will be a new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint.

-> Encryption:

Encryption at rest is supported for MySQL,Oracle,SQLSevrver,PostgreSQL,Mariadb and aurora.Encryption is done using the aws key managment service (KMS) service. Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted ,as are its automated backups, read replicas and snapshots.

At the present time, encrypting an existing DB insatnce is not supported. To use amazon RDS encryption for an existing database, you must first creaet snapshot, make a copy of that snapshot and encrypt the copy.
 
-> Multi-AZ RDS
 
Multi-AZ allows you to have an exact copy of your production database in another availability zone. AWS handles the replications for you , so when your production databse is written to , this write will automatically be synchronized to the stand by databases.

In the event of planned databases maintinanace, DB instance failure, or an Availability Zone failure, Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby so that database operations can resume quickly without administrative intervention.

## It is not used for improving performance. For performance improvment, you need read replicas.

* Available Databases for Multi-AZ 

SQL Server
Oracle
MySQL Server
PostgreSQL
MariaDB

-> Read Replicas:

Read replicas allow you to have a read-only copy of your production database.This is achieved by using Asynchronous replication from the primary RDS instance to the read replica. You use read replicas pimarily for very heavy database workloads.(can be in different region also).

* Available Databases for Multi-AZ 

Oracle
MySQL Server
PostgreSQL
MariaDB

* Used for scaling , not for DR
* must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a read replica.
* you can have upto 5 read replica copies of any database.
* you can read replicas of read replicas (but watch out for latency).
* Each read replica will have its own DNS endpoint.
* you can have read replicas that have multi AZ
* you can create read replicas of multi AZ source database.
* read replicas can promoted to be their own databases .THis breaks the replication
* you can have a read replica in a second region.
