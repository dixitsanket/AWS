AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery service.

Code PIpleline can orchestrate the build,test,and even deployment of your application every time there is a change to your code - all based on a user defined software release process.

Traditional manual approaches to code delivery can be slow and prone to errors, whereas an automated process allows developer to frequently release new feature and bug

fixes in a fast and reliable way.

CodePipeline allows you to model your release process as a workflow or pipeline made up of different tasks, such as the simple workflow represented below.

You define what happens and where for each of the different stages of the workflow,and this can be modelled using the codePipeline GUI or CLI.

Integrates with codecommit,codebuild,codedeploy,lambda,elastic beanstalk,cloudformation,elastic container service as well as third party tools like github and jenkins

Every code change pushed to your code repository automatically entres the workflow and trigger the set of action defined for each stage of the pipeline.

The pipeline automatically stops if one of the stages fails.For example,if one of your automated unit tests fails.This means that bug are caught before the code is deployed while they are still easy to fix.
