							PROVISIONED THROUGHPUT EXCEEDED EXCEPTION

* Your requests rate is too high for the read/write capacity provisioned on your dynamodb table
* SDK will automatically retries the requests until successful
* If you are not using SDK you can:
	* Reduce request frequency
	* Use Exponential Backoff

-> Exponential Backoff

* Many component in a network can generate error due to being overloaded
* In addition to simple retries all AWS SDK use Exponential Backoff
* Progressively longer wait between consecutive retries e.g. 50ms,100ms,200ms.... for improved flow control
* if after 1min this doesnt work,your request size may be exceeding the throughput for your read/write capacity
