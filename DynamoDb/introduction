Amazon DynamoDB is fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all application that need consistent, single digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed databse and supports both document and key value data models.Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile,web,gaming,ad-tech,Iot and many other applications.

* Stored on SSD storage
* Spread Across 3 geographically distinct data centres
* Choice of 2 consistency models:
	* Eventual Consistent Reads(Default)
	* Strongly Consistent Reads

-> Eventual Consistent Reads:

Consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second.Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data.(Best Read Performance)

-> Strongly Consistent Reads:

A strongly consistency read returns a result that reflects all writes that recieved a successful response prior to the read.

-> Tables
	* Items
	* Attribute
	* Supports key-value and document data structures
	* KEY = The name of data, Value = the data itself
	* Documents can be written in JSON,HTML or XML

-> DynamoDB-Primary Keys:
	* DynamoDB stores and retrieves data based on primary key
	* 2 types of primary key:
		* Partition Key-unique attribute(eg userID)
			* Value of the partition key is input to an internal hash function which determines the partiton or physical location on which 					the data is store 
			* If you are using the partiton key as your primary key,then no two item can have same parttion key.

		* Composite Key(Partiton Key+Sort Key):
			* e.g. Same user posting multiple time to a a forum
			* Primary Key would a Composite Key consisting of:
			* Partition Key-UserID	
			* Sort Key-Timestamp of the post
			* 2 items may have the same partition key,but they must have a different Sort Key
			* All item with the same partition key are stored together,then sorted according to the sort key value
			* Allow you to store multiple items with same partiton key.
